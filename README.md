![pexels-poranimm-athithawatthee-851177](https://github.com/nwyGit/Python-DVD-Rental-Analysis/assets/105307947/e42b25fb-9bfe-4748-8fa4-39e1e6b3be07)

This Python project involves analyzing data from the DVD Rental database using Pandas and visualizing the results with Matplotlib.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will be using Pandas in Python to analyze data extracted from the DVD Rental database. We'll perform various data manipulations, transformations, and visualizations to answer specific questions related to the dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Download the DVD Rental sample database from [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/) or use the provided data.
4. Install the required libraries. (pandas, matplotlib, textblob)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the DVD Rental database or data CSV files.
- `code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook files for analysis.

## Analysis and Visualizations

This section will describe the analysis and visualizations performed on the DVD Rental database.

1. **Time-Series Plot**: Daily total revenue for different countries.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Added a sentiment classification column based on movie descriptions.
3. **Country Revenue Visual**: Visualization of revenue contribution from different countries.
4. **Top Revenue Actors**: Analysis of the top 10 actors bringing in the most revenue.
5. **Country Classification**: Created a new DataFrame to classify countries.
6. **Merging Data**: Merged the country classification with the DVD database.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `code.ipynb`.
2. Run the code cells to perform analysis and generate visualizations.
3. Modify the code to customize analysis based on your needs.
